            <p class = "solotext">Generative AI represents one of the most advanced technologies in this era. Generative AI provides the ability to create works which are hard to tell the difference with human’s. machines are no longer limited to collect and learn from data, but also create new content in various ways. However, Generative AI still has different concerns wherever in society, technology, or ethics.</p>

        <h2  align = "Center">About GenAI</h2>
        <p class = "solotext">Generative AI refers to AI (artificial intelligence) that is capable of automatically generating content with a high degree of similarity to human-created content, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.
        It is a type of machine-learning algorithm to generate models to understand those patterns and features in large datasets which it then uses to generate new content.
        Humans commonly use generative AI for various types of content creation, such as images, video, music, text, etc. Since there is currently no clear legal regulation of this generative content, while people are enjoying the generated content by generative AI, copyright-related issues may arise.
